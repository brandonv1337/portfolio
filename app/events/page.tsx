       Hello! My name is Brandon Valadez and I am a 2nd year college student at Drake University. I am studying computer science and mathematics with a minor in artificial intelligence. I enjoy developing frontend websites (I am currently learning backend :D), creating video games, and studying mathematics! In the summer of 2024 I started my development for The Stayover and have since made it into an operation that I am putting my max effort into. I have learned many different things about game development and, in particular, working in a collaborative environment. I also spent some time working on recreational mathematics and preparing myself for competitive math and coding competitions. <br /><br /><br /><br />In my free time I enjoy playing my accordion and spending time with my family. I learned the accordion during my years in highschool after listening to years of Tejano and Norte√±o music. I am at my happiest when I am in the backyard of my childhood home eating some good Texas fajitas and ribs while listening to Tejano music with my family.
